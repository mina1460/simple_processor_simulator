[0] The SIM just stored the value 1 in memory location 3 now with value 1
[1] The SIM just stored the value 2 in memory location 4 now with value 2
[2] The SIM just added memory location 3 with value 1 and memory location 4 with value 2 and stored it in memory location 10 now with value 3
[3] The SIM just negated memory location 10 with value 3 and stored it in memory location 11 now with value -3
[4] The SIM just checked memory location 5 with value 0 and it was 0, so it jumped to instruction address 10
[10] The SIM just negated memory location 11 with value -3 and stored it in memory location 12 now with value 3
[11] The SIM just multiplied memory location 11 with value -3 and memory location 12 with value 3 and stored it in memory location 13 now with value -9
[12] The SIM just stored the value 20 in memory location 5 now with value 20
[13] The SIM just jumped to instruction address 3
[3] The SIM just negated memory location 10 with value 3 and stored it in memory location 11 now with value -3
[4] The SIM just checked memory location 5 with value 20 and it was not 0, so it did not jump to memory address 5
[5] The SIM just added memory location 5 with value 20 and memory location 13 with value -9 and stored it in memory location 14 now with value 11
[6] Error executing instruction: Instruction address out of range for JPA instruction
